# ptxconf

Pen tablet and Touch screen Xinput Configuration tool (PTXConf). Configures
touch/pen devices to work with extended desktops and multiple screens on Linux.
Please find the installation and usage instructions in the documentation
located here:
[wenhsinjen.github.io/ptxconf/](http://wenhsinjen.github.io/ptxconf/)

This repo is a modified version for my own purposes. In particular, I don't
have a systray so I'm not guaranteeing any of that to work.
